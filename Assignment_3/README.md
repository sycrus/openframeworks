# Project Descriptions #

## Animation ##
### Idea 1: 3D world spin and movement ###
This idea involves a 3D protagonist moving between scenes in a simulated 3D world, which is a miniaturized globe with objects dropping onto it. In each scene he interacts with objects that result in drama. Ideally, there will be some kind of match (shape, movement, color) as each scene ends and the other begins. This project would allow me to focus more on animation. <br>

#### User ####
Digital media user on portable devices; suitable for all ages, appealing more to young adults.

#### Experience ####
A story that is told in a compelling way, tied together with a strong design theme.

#### Translation ####
My translation will accomplish this through use of surprise and humor, will have a visually distinct palette, and rhythmic with repeated transitions/animations.

### Idea 2: Projection mapping ###
This idea involves a 2D protagonist projected onto real world 3D surfaces, and the story unfolds around the real world 3D surfaces. This project would allow me to focus more on characters interacting with the real world environment. <br>

#### User ####
Visitor to an installation/interactive exhibit, suitable for all ages, appealing more to children.

## JSON ##
### Sensor Data projected on flat surface ###
This idea involves taking some form of sensor data (sound, video capture/CV, Kinect) and creating a set of tools tied to interactions that enable interesting visualizations. At this point the theme is not decided yet, but should allow me to experiment with what would be interesting given the interactions. Example of this is Connected Worlds at NYSCI. This project would allow me to focus more on users’ interactions and creating visualizations/sonifications based on the meaningfulness of their interactions.

#### User ####
Visitor to an installation/interactive exhibit, suitable for all ages, appealing more to young adults.

#### Experience ####
An interactive, real-time experience that engages users to experiment, collaborate and create visually interesting effects.

#### Translation ####
My translation will accomplish this through effects using mesh deformation, particles/flocking, noise.

## Game ##
### Projection Mapping on Interactive Objects ###
This idea involves several tangible 3D shapes/sensors that can be manipulated in real-time to generate a projected 2D game level. It could be a simple physics game like pinball or a Mario type of platformer. This project would allow me to focus more on designing for 3D interactive spaces.

#### User ####
Visitor to an installation/interactive exhibit, suitable for all ages, appealing more to teens.

#### Experience ####
An interactive, real-time experience that engages users to experiment, collaborate and create game experiences.

#### Translation ####
My translation will accomplish this through 3D objects, sensors/controllers (knobs, buttons etc).

## This week's coding assignment: Group 1 ##
### void ofDrawBitmapString(const T &textString, float x, float y) ###
This function outputs a bitmapped textString at location (x,y) on the screen.

### void ofDrawCircle(float x, float y, float radius) ###
This function draws a circle with radius at its center at location (x,y) on the screen.

### void ofDrawCurve(float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2, float x3, float y3) ### 
This function draws a curve from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2). The curve is shaped by the two control points (x0,y0) and (x3,y3).
