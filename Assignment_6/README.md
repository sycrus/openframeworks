This week I implemented fbo to create a fade effect, added text using Futura (TrueType font), and enabled users to click on a location for the sun.

I also refined the code from last week, converting x and y coordinates over to vectors and offsets. I added animations (rotation, easing) to get it closer to what I hope to accomplish for my final projects.
